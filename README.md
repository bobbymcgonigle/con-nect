### The Problem
Not everyone is technology savvy. Some users, particularly the elderly and disabled arenâ€™t able to differentiate between legitimate phone numbers and numbers attempting to scam them.

To produce a new call handling application that could better notify users of potentially hazardous incoming calls, in particular unsolicited international calls and act as a filtering system for legitimate and illegitimate calls.
